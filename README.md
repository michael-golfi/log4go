## Golang library for logging

This library seeks to replicate the interface of the log4j library with similar functionality.

```

## Duplicated libraries

This project was originally hosted on Google code. When Google decided they were going to shut down code, I forked this library and decided to maintain a copy for my own purposes. All rights are reserved for the original creators.
